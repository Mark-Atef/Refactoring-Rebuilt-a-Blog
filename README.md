## ✅ Project Objectives

### ✔️ 1. Improve HTML Structure
- Used semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` for better structure and accessibility.

### ✔️ 2. Improve CSS
- All styles were moved to an external CSS file (`styles.css`).
- CSS variables were implemented using the `:root` selector for maintainability.
- Color contrast and visual consistency were enhanced.

### ✔️ 3. Additions and Enhancements
- ✅ A “Back to Top” button appears when scrolling down and uses smooth scrolling.
- ✅ A responsive navigation menu using Bootstrap.
- ✅ A simple and accessible contact form added to the footer section.

### ✔️ 4. Performance and Loading
- Linked external resources using CDN (Bootstrap).
- Scripts and styles are organized and loaded efficiently.
- Layout and styling were kept lightweight to ensure fast loading.

### ✔️ 5. Documentation
- Helpful comments added to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- This README explains the project structure and usage clearly.
